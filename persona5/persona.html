        <p class="content-para">Persona 5 is a 2016 role-playing video game developed by Atlus. It is the sixth
            installment in the Persona series, which is part of the larger Megami Tensei franchise. It was released for
            the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 in Japan in September 2016 and worldwide in April 2017, and was
            published by Atlus in Japan and North America and by Deep Silver in Europe and Australia. An enhanced
            version featuring new content, Persona 5 Royal, was released for the PlayStation 4 in Japan in October
            2019 and worldwide in March 2020, published by Atlus in Japan and North America and by franchise owner Sega
            in Europe and Australia.</p>
        <p class="content-para">
            Persona 5 takes place in modern-day Tokyo and follows a high school student known by the pseudonym Joker who
            transfers to a new school after being falsely accused of assault and put on probation. Over the course of a
            school year, he and other students awaken to a special power, becoming a group of secret vigilantes known as
            the Phantom Thieves of Hearts. They explore the Metaverse, a supernatural realm born from humanity's
            subconscious desires, to steal malevolent intent from the hearts of adults. As with previous games in the
            series, the party battles enemies known as Shadows using physical manifestations of their psyche known as
            their Personas. The game incorporates role-playing and dungeon crawling elements alongside social simulation
            scenarios.

        <p class="content-para">
            The game is known to be very stylish, especially when the player triggers the all out attacks and the
            character potraits that follows
            up after the attack is finished.
