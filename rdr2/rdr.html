        <p class="content-para">Red Dead Redemption 2 (stylized as Red Dead Redemption II) is a western-themed
            action-adventure video game developed and published by Rockstar Games. It is the third entry in the Red Dead
            series and a prequel to 2010's Red Dead Redemption</p>
        <p class="content-para">
            Set in a fictional recreation of the American Old West in 1899, Red Dead Redemption 2 focuses on the life of
            Arthur Morgan and his position in the notorious Van der Linde gang. The game follows the gang's decline as
            they are pursued by lawmen, fellow gangs and Pinkerton agents. The narrative revolves around the characters
            of Dutch van der Linde, John Marston and Micah Bell in addition to Morgan.

            Red Dead Redemption 2 is set in an open world consisting of five American regions, which the player can
            explore as they proceed with the story, and can be played through both third-person and first-person view.
            As Arthur Morgan, players can interact with the game world in several ways, including story missions, side
            quests, challenges, randomized events, and hunting. An Honor system, returning from the previous game,
            changes accordingly to the player's actions towards non-player characters.
