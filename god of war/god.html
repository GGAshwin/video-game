        <p class="content-para">God of War (also known as God of War IV) is the sequel to God of War III as well as a
            continuation of the canon God of War chronology. God of War is the eighth installment in the franchise
            overall.</p>
        <p class="content-para">
            Many years have passed since Kratos took his vengeance against the Olympian gods. Having survived his final
            encounter with his father Zeus, Kratos has since travelled to Midgard in Ancient Norway and now lives with
            his young son Atreus in the world of the Norse gods, a savage land inhabited by many ferocious monsters and
            warriors. In order to teach his son, whose mother (and Kratos's second wife) has recently died, how to
            survive in such a world, Kratos must master the rage that has driven him for many years and embrace his
            newfound role as a father and a mentor.
